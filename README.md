# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment-Analysis is where a ML model identifies a statement's sentiment - positive or negative. In this project, I have used Logistic Regression to carry out the sentiment analysis and have also deployed it using the Dash library in python. The model was trained with data taken from amazon's website, click [here](http://deepyeti.ucsd.edu/jianmo/amazon/categoryFiles/Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry.json.gz) to download the data. Data was also scrapped from the client website, click [here](https://www.etsy.com/) to go to the website.
